# Hey there 👋
I'm Oleksandr — a software engineering student based in Germany, focusing on backend development, systems fundamentals, and building clean, reliable software.

Currently studying **Software Engineering (B.Sc.) at the University of Stuttgart**, where I work with Java, algorithms, data structures, and low-level concepts like RISC‑V. Outside university, I spend most of my time exploring backend architectures, improving coding workflows, and building practical tools.

This profile documents my progression as an engineer — real projects, university work, experiments, and everything I build to grow professionally.
